          I have taken ITMD-361, ITMD-362, and ITMD-441 so I am already quite familiar with html, css, and javascript. I just have to try to remember more about what I learned in those 
          courses because I think I already forgot somethings but with some review I should be fine. So far I am really enjoying writing html, css, and javascript. So I am pretty excited 
          to be taking another course that deals with html, css, and javascript. Every now and then I like to build websites for fun just so I can try out new things with html, css, and 
          javascript, and even learn new things while I am at it. I am really looking forward to learn how I can not only improve my code but also learn more about it as it is my favorite 
          thing to learn about in school. Anyways, here is the intro to the class and me.

          Hello! My name is Rafael Armenta. I am a third year ITM student and work part time at an Amazon Fulfillment Center. I am really looking forward to learning even more about 
          web development. From all the courses I have taken at IIT, I have got to say that web development has been the most enjoyable one so far. Besides learning more about 
          web development I like to play video games, watch anime, and hanging out with friends. Really looking forward to learn more about Full-Stack Web Development. Anyways, hope
          you do not mind this placeholder text here until I finish more labs so I can link them throughout the page.
